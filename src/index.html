            Carson's culinary journey began in Atlanta, where the city's vibrant
            food scene ignited his passion for exploration. Inspired by the
            eclectic mix of restaurants, diners, and pop-ups, Carson set forth
            on a quest to uncover new flavors and sensations. This adventureous
            spirit propelled him to the forefront of global culinary innovation.
            Despite his international reach, many of Carson's dishes are rooted
            in the memories of family meals at beloved eateries in his hometown.
